Docker Dev Notes
================

Using Docker in development helps produce a consistent environment that's close
to the real production site.

Setup
=====

This documentation is going to assume you have Docker installed and configured
already. See the [Docker documentation][docker-docs] for help.

[docker-docs]: https://docs.docker.com/

* To launch the containers:

  `make up`

  Running `docker-compose up` from the root directory starts the database and
  web server. The host machine and web server container share a volume.

Testing
=======

Syntax & unit tests must pass for Pull Requests to be accepted on GitHub.

* To run all tests:

  `make test`

Tips & Tricks
=============

* To shell into the server container:

  `make shell`

  This is necessary for running Django commands, among other things.

* If you change `requirements.txt` to add dependencies for Django, you must rebuild `server`:

  `make build`


Getting Production Data
=======================

Sometimes it is useful to develop against production data. To do this we
trigger a backup on Heroku, download the backup, and import it into our docker
conainter's database.

**NOTE**: This assumes you have a Heroku git remote named "prod" tracking the
production branch on Heroku.

* Create a new backup. Take note of the backup ID:

  `heroku pg:backups:capture --remote prod`

* If needed, you can list all the current backups:

  `heroku pg:backups --remote prod`

* Download the backup file. Change "b001" to the backup ID noted above.:

  `heroku pg:backups:download --remote prod -o latest.dump b001`

* Shell into the docker container:

  `make shell`

* Import the database:

  `pg_restore -h db -U postgres -d postgres --clean latest.dump`
